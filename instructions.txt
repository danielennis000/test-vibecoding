Great! You want to build a simple frontend landing page for an iOS AI tutor app using Cursor, Tailwind CSS, and deploy it to GitHub Pages with a GitHub repo. Here's a clear plan:

Set up GitHub repo
Create a new GitHub repository (public or private).
Initialize with a README.md.
Initialize Cursor project
Use Cursor to scaffold a new frontend project.
Choose a simple React or vanilla JS template (Cursor supports React well).
Add Tailwind CSS
Install Tailwind CSS dependencies.
Configure Tailwind with a minimal config file.
Add Tailwind directives to your CSS.
Build landing page
Create a simple landing page with:
App name and tagline
Brief description of AI tutor features
Call-to-action button (e.g., "Download on App Store")
Responsive layout using Tailwind utilities
Test locally
Run the project locally to verify layout and responsiveness.
Deploy to GitHub Pages
Configure GitHub Pages in repo settings to serve from main branch or /docs folder.
Add deployment script (e.g., using gh-pages npm package) or push built static files to the correct branch/folder.
Document repo
Add instructions in README for local dev and deployment.
